# Time_Series
Forecasting with time series:

1. **Predicting Google stock in 2017** (*straight forward* regression model)
  First attempt of an *RNN* project, the data was not extremely easy to predict, but it was reasonable. The main concepts implemented are *preprocessing* with *pandas* and *sklearn* as well as learning with RNN's that contain *LSTM cells* and *dropout layers*.
  
2. **Predicting Sunspots** (*very complicated* regression problem)
* Full project with hours of experimentation that combined most deep learning topics. Non-ML topics implemented included but were not limited to *preprocessing series data from csv file*, *windowed dataset*, *plotting series data and loss functions*. ML topics implemented were *RNNs*, *Convolutional Layers*, *multi-LSTM layers*, *bidirectionality of LSTMs*, *lambda layers*, *callback functions for learning rate optimization*, and *hyper parameter tweaking*. 
* This was potentially one of the most time consuming deep learning projects that I had to tackle because the loss would not be easily reduced and I had to utilize everything I learned to make a respectable model.

As always, thanks for taking an interest in my learning process! I challenge you to improve my final sunspots model!
